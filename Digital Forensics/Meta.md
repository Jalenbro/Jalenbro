Steganography involves hiding messages or data within seemingly ordinary content that doesn’t appear suspicious or secretive.

But how does steganography play a role in cybercrime? Digital images are often targeted because they contain redundant data that can be altered without noticeably changing the image’s appearance. Given their widespread use, image files rarely trigger suspicion of malicious intent. Additionally, videos, documents, and audio files can serve as alternative mediums for embedding harmful payloads using steganographic methods.

We download the given file and extract its contents and get into solving the challenges.

We'll use ExifTool, a tool designed to display diagnostic information, to reveal the metadata of an image. A quick look at an image file’s metadata provides a solid starting point for analysis.

Answer: relying on altered metadata to catch me?


 ## Where could the criminal be?

 The final challenge involved performing a reverse image search on the images. I prefer using Yandex for image searches because it provides more extensive and diverse results compared to other search engines. When I searched with the first image, it returned various locations, so I moved on to the second image, which successfully pinpointed the criminal’s exact location.
