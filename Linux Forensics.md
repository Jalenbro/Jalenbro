 ## Linux Forensics — Learn about the common forensic artifacts found in the file system of Linux Operating System | Solutions

As we did in the Windows Forensics rooms, we will start by identifying the system and finding basic information about the system. In the case of Windows, we identified that the Windows Registry contains information about the Windows machine. For a Linux system, everything is stored in a file. Therefore, to identify forensic artifacts, we will need to know the locations of these files and how to read them. Below, we will start by identifying System information on a Linux host.
