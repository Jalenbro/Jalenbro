Splunk is one of the leading SIEM solutions in the market that provides the ability to collect, analyze and correlate the network and machine logs in real-time. In this room, we will explore the basics of Splunk and its functionalities and how it provides better visibility of network activities and help in speeding up the detection.

Splunk has three main components, namely Forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head. These components are explained below:

Splunk components



Splunk Forwarder

Splunk Forwarder is a lightweight agent installed on the endpoint intended to be monitored, and its main task is to collect the data and send it to the Splunk instance. It does not affect the endpoint's performance as it takes very few resources to process. Some of the key data sources are:

Web server generating web traffic.
Windows machine generating Windows Event Logs, PowerShell, and Sysmon data.
Linux host generating host-centric logs.
Database generating DB connection requests, responses, and errors.

Splunk Indexer

Splunk Indexer plays the main role in processing the data it receives from forwarders. It takes the data, normalizes it into field-value pairs, determines the datatype of the data, and stores them as events. Processed data is easy to search and analyze.

Search Head

Splunk Search Head is the place within the Search & Reporting App where users can search the indexed logs as shown below. When the user searches for a term or uses a Search language known as Splunk Search Processing Language, the request is sent to the indexer and the relevant events are returned in the form of field-value pairs.

Search Head also provides the ability to transform the results into presentable tables, visualizations like pie-chart, bar-chart and column-chart, as shown below:

Which component is used to collect and send data over the Splunk instance?
## forwarder

ï»¿Splunk Bar

When you access Splunk, you will see the default home screen identical to the screenshot below.

Shows splunk Interface

Let's look at each section, or panel, that makes up the home screen. The top panel is the Splunk Bar (below image). 

Shows splunk Bar

In the Splunk Bar, you can see system-level messages (Messages), configure the Splunk instance (Settings), review the progress of jobs (Activity), miscellaneous information such as tutorials (Help), and a search feature (Find). 

The ability to switch between installed Splunk apps instead of using the Apps panel can be achieved from the Splunk Bar, like in the image below.

Apps Panel

Next is the Apps Panel.  In this panel, you can see the apps installed for the Splunk instance. 

The default app for every Splunk installation is Search & Reporting.

Explore Splunk

The next section is Explore Splunk. This panel contains quick links to add data to the Splunk instance, add new Splunk apps, and access the Splunk documentation. 

Shows Option to add data, access documentation, add new splunk apps

Splunk Dashboard

The last section is the Home Dashboard. By default, no dashboards are displayed. You can choose from a range of dashboards readily available within your Splunk instance. You can select a dashboard from the dropdown menu or by visiting the dashboards listing page.

You can also create dashboards and add them to the Home Dashboard. The dashboards you create can be viewed isolated from the other dashboards by clicking on the Yours tab.
