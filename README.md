Brief Introduction 

As a York University graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, I have a vast array of knowledge in the current leading practice in information security awareness and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies. Specifically, I am well-versed in Linux, Python, and SQL, through various technical projects. I have also obtained the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, which has provided me with hands-on experience in SIEM Tools and IDS such as Chronicle, Splunk, and Suricata.

## Objective
I am very passionate about using my abilities to serve in a Security Analyst 
 team. I am driven to produce high-quality deliverables through a detail-oriented approach. I believe my dedication and strong work ethic will make me an asset to any team. I am eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a (SOC) role as a Tier 1 Analyst.
